            The word Universe derives from the Latin universum. The Latin word was used by Cicero and later by other authors with the same meaning that is used today. The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum—first used by Lucretius in Book IV of his "On the Nature of Things"—which connects un, uni (one) with vorsum, versum (meaning "something rotated, rolled, or changed").
